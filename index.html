    <h1>DevOps Stage 0 - NGINX Configuration</h1>
</header>

<article>
    <h2>1. Approach to Completing the Task</h2>
    <p>
        My approach to this task was to first break it down into smaller steps. Since I wasn't extremely familiar with the specifics of configuring a web server like NGINX, I started by researching the general steps involved in setting up NGINX on an Ubuntu server. This included reading about installing NGINX, configuring the default page, and ensuring the setup was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also made sure to reach out to the DevOps community and my team members when I encountered any challenges. Their insights were invaluable, especially in areas where I wasn’t sure about the next step.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them</h2>
    <h3>Credential Issues (Password Reset)</h3>
    <p>
        One of the major challenges I faced was forgetting my sudo password. Since I had been practicing using my Windows system (via WSL), I had installed several applications and forgot my login credentials. I had to quickly learn how to reset my password, which took some time and research. However, after following the right steps to reset my password, I regained access to my system and was able to continue with the task.
    </p>

    <h3>Terminal Issues (Copy-Paste Functionality)</h3>
    <p>
        Another challenge was the inability to copy and paste commands in the terminal. This led to a lot of retyping, especially when I was working on my custom HTML page. Although this slowed me down a bit, I managed to type the HTML code manually and carefully check for typos.
    </p>

    <h3>Verification of Configuration and Logs</h3>
    <p>
        There were times when my NGINX configuration wasn’t working as expected. I had to use the <code>nginx -t</code> command to check for syntax errors in my configuration file. Additionally, I referred to the system logs to debug the issues, which ultimately helped me fix the configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How This Task Contributes to My Learning and Professional Goals</h2>
    <p>
        This task helped me develop a deeper understanding of how web servers work, particularly NGINX, which is commonly used in DevOps workflows. It provided hands-on experience with setting up and configuring a web server, as well as troubleshooting common issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an aspiring DevOps engineer, this task is a step toward mastering the skills I need to manage server infrastructure. Understanding the fundamentals of web server configurations and troubleshooting is essential in my professional growth. This task has given me the confidence to tackle more complex server-related problems in the future.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, this task provided a valuable learning experience. Although I encountered some challenges along the way, they were all opportunities for growth. I now feel more comfortable working with NGINX and managing web servers in general. I look forward to applying what I’ve learned to more complex DevOps tasks in the future.
